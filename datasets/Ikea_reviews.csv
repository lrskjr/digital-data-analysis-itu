"August 10, 2019",Cannot log in with my IKEA family login. Keeps telling me my password is wrong. When I try to reset it it just tells me my username is wrong. I am very sure that I did not mistype either of them. When I try to create a normal non-IKEA-family login it tells me the service is unavailable right now. Would love to try the app and give a better rating... But right now all I can say is it is garbage.,22.0,User1546
"August 24, 2019",When I attempt to login it just kicks me out and when I do login it shows that I still need to login. I've reset my password so many times that is kind of a joke up to this point. I just want to pay my card off!!! Don't worry I've tried the website as well and it doesn't the same thing.,3.0,User2546
"August 21, 2019","The application seems promising.. if you could actually use it. I've been unable to link my IKEA account to it, always getting a message about failed synchronization. Soo, no lists, no shopping, no nothing, all you can do is check as an anonymous user, which isin't great.",1.0,User1406
"June 9, 2019","It syncs with desktop and gives the code and location of your items in the store of your choice. However, it doesn't show combos in your cart that were added using one of the planners. It doesn't let you order your basket in a logical order for collection. If there is an item in one combo that is also in another, it doesn't combine them so you can collect them at the same time. I also hate that I have to keep logging on every time I open the app.",75.0,User1497
"August 24, 2019","Poor Ux - get better! I followed all steps, installed the app, set up Ikea Family account, had an account number shown on screen, then could not connect the app with the account because I missed the account number. Checked the 2 emails from Ikea, number was not present. Fiddled with the website for 15 minutes, could not find number. Asked chat support, they told me to check number on card. Card not received, been told to check number on website. Checked again, number not found. Uninstall. The end",1.0,User296
"August 17, 2019","This app used to be great for making lists and finding items in store. Since the beginning of August though, I haven't been able to log in to the app, so I am unable to access my list, or my family card. essentially unless I have a paper list and only need to look at the location of the item in store, the app is pretty useless.",4.0,User114
"June 11, 2019","There's no obvious way to create a wishlist on this app. So it's impossible to use for forward planning. The USA version let's you create shopping lists. I can't find any way of doing that in the UK version. Ultimately its useless I will update my review. I want to buy some waste bins for the house. It's impossible to know which department they are in, so i searched bins. They came up and were labeled as being in the home organisation department. There's no link to that department. Awful. Awful",7.0,User75

"May 14, 2019","It's not the worst app ever but it's not great at all. I want the app to be able to SHOP not just make lists. If you want to buy anything you have to open it in your browser... that makes no sense to me! They should rename it to like IKEA In Store Finder or something bc I've heard it's helpful for that, however, as someone not close to a store, I'm only interested in purchasing online in an app. Will uninstall AGAIN.",724.0,User922
"March 9, 2019","This app has very limited use and it's for items available in the store. After doing some heavy surfing/research I found a similar item (best deal) at Ikea online and I bought it. For some odd reason I saw the FedEx truck at the house next door, then he threw it in reverse, turned and went down the street before my house. I didn't get my order until two days later (3 days on FedEx truck). I finally got my order and start putting it together and it was missing two parts. I'm finished with Ikea.",19.0,User1345

I cant seem to search bedroom lamps (table lamps) withiut getting kitchen prndant light fixtures. Many searches produce duplicate results (some with reviews some without). Item descriptions include to much irrelevant information (This product bears the CE seal!) and lack basic information ; is the ice cream scoop a 4 pack (shown in picture) or a two pack (as described), idk!",4.0,User1515
"July 6, 2019",guess it's not as I expected it to be you can't purchase items in the app and set up Delivery it's more like item list for that store you have to be there and physically get the items you need it helps you that way. but there is no online purchasing the nearest IKEA store is 50 minutes away from where I live so I can be asked to go there myself regardless it's almost useless if you ask me. and the fact that's under Shopping with no purchase capability it's just misleading,18.0,User52
"April 17, 2019","Where is the buy option? Put an item into my shopping list, and then... nothing. No check out. No profile to edit my address either, making it clear this app is ONLY for recording shopping lists. No better than a catalogue. Seriously? It's 2019.

"March 9, 2019",No option to opt out of location tracking . Which is a GDPR violation. Why IKEA believes that it has the right to track and store my every move because I might want to buy something off them is a fine example of surveillance capitalism. Immediately uninstalled!,391.0,User1402

Yes the app tells you what department it is in and if you can go straight to self-serve, what aisle, bay and product number. However, in a store that is set up more as an shopping adventure than a mere shopping experience, an interactive map can be a boon for both the customer and as a marketing tool/data mine.

I never get one. So I call back again next day. Now they say that my order is cancelled and returned back to the store. The CC did try to call me on Monday and left a voicemail asking me to call a certain number with an extension. I tried literally 100 times on the extension and no response.

(wardrobe) The only way out was to contact customer care, and it took 4 hours to contact them. Literally!!! Believe me. I was kept on HOLD on the phone line straight for 2 hours!!!! Trust me! Finally when I talked to them they said it will take next one week if I put that complain online or you can go to the store and talk to them and they MIGHT resolve it within 72 hours. So this is it.

Ova opcija ne funkcioniše uopšte, tj. nema načina da se bilo kakva šifra unese, i otprilike proces naručivanja se ovde efektivno završava. Dodatni problem je i taj što se kroz aplikaciju, kao i kroz ceo Ikea online sistem za naručivanje, ne može videti istorija narudžbenica.

After fiddling about in store (their ikea wireless wasn't working so made matters worse) i clicked a tick icon which then stopped showing me how many units i had reserved. Since i was using the app to record how many i wanted, not being able to see this info or if the items were actually reserved meant i ended up trying to get the number back but in doing so the items were removed with no undo function. I didn't trust they had been reserved so i manually went and grabbed what I needed but couldn't remember how many i wanted and ended up not getting enough.

And navigating the website is inconvenient on the phone when you have an application that has the potential capabilities to do it. So it is kind of a disappointment.
